# Cirq-Basics
The basics of Cirq
-- creating and naming qubits
-- creating a circuit and appending qubits to the circuit as well as measuring them
-- simulating the results of your circuit
-- printing vector and ket notations, as well as bloch sphere representation. 
---- for the bloch sphere representation: it wont show on here, but if you were to run the code in your IDE, you will see an image of the bloch sphere representation of the vector.
